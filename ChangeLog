	The Removers Library.

1.3.5
-----
	Renamed fb2d_copy_straight to screen_copy_straight and moved to
	screen module.

	Separated Protracker Replay routine and Paula emulator. You should
	now link against paula.o and protracker.o to stay compatible. Also
	defined paula_def.s for low level programming of Paula emulator.
	
1.3.4
-----
	Updated Makefile and build script.
	
1.3.3
-----
	Fixed a bug in vline.s, thanks to Hyper_eye.
	Fixed a bug in gets (skunkboard).
	Reversed order of this ChangeLog.

1.3.2
-----
	Optimisation of Paula emulator. Implements samples prefetch.

1.3.1
-----
	Changed way balance of each voice is computed.

1.3.0
-----
	Rewrote a new Paula emulator, which is (almost) retro-compatible
	with previous Paula emulator. The only drawback of this new
	emulator is that it uses the DSP entirely. Hence the DSP is now
	devoted to sound generation. For compatibility reasons, the
	previous Paula emulator is kept in the distribution, but new
	applications should use the new Paula emulator, which is far more
	efficient.

1.2.5
-----
	Added "clear screen" option to the renderer.
	Added option to enable/disable flat shading when texturing.
	Fixed several bugs in the renderer.

1.2.4
-----
	Gouraud shading has been fixed so that now the renderer try to use
	phrase mode of the blitter and if it cannot, it uses pixel mode
	instead. This should solve several issues due to limitation of
	phrase mode that was always used before this fix.

1.2.3
-----
	The trivial clipping algorithm was so trivial that it was buggy on
	textured/gouraud shaded/Zbuffered polygons... now this problem is
	fixed. But this clipping algorithm should be seen as no more than
	a provisional solution.

1.2.2
-----
	I finally decided to enable the texture gouraud shading since it
	seems to work well. Beware that textures should be modified so
	that it works (intensities should be XORed with 0x80).

	I also enabled the trivial clipping algorithm by default.

1.2.1
-----
	Correction of a small bug in rendering routine.

	The texture gouraud shading code has been added but it is disabled at
	compilation.

1.2.0
-----
	Addition of this ChangeLog file.

	Removal of memalign since Jaguar C Library now includes a powerful
	memory allocator.

	Clean up of several sources. Reorganisation of the source tree (no
	more symbolic links!)

	Addition of a software renderer.
