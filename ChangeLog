	The Removers Library.

1.2.0
-----
	Addition of this ChangeLog file.

	Removal of memalign since Jaguar C Library now includes a powerful
	memory allocator.

	Clean up of several sources. Reorganisation of the source tree (no
	more symbolic links!)
	
	Addition of a software renderer. 

1.2.1
-----
	Correction of a small bug in rendering routine.
	
	The texture gouraud shading code has been added but it is disabled at
	compilation.

1.2.2
-----
	I finally decided to enable the texture gouraud shading since it
	seems to work well. Beware that textures should be modified so
	that it works (intensities should be XORed with 0x80).

	I also enabled the trivial clipping algorithm by default.

1.2.3
-----
	The trivial clipping algorithm was so trivial that it was buggy on
	textured/gouraud shaded/Zbuffered polygons... now this problem is
	fixed. But this clipping algorithm should be seen as no more than
	a provisional solution.
