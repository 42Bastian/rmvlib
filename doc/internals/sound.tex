\section{Paula emulator, version 1.0}

The Paula emulator is able to resample and mix 8 independent stereo
voices.

\subsection{Voice description}
Each voice is described thanks to several \public{} fields.  Several
\private{} fields are also used for performing replay.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    field name & policy & description \\
    \hline
    \fname{START} & \public & start address of sound data \\
    \fname{LENGTH} & \public & length of sound data in bytes \\
    \fname{CONTROL} & \public & replay characteristics (see below)\\
    \hline
    \hline
    \fname{CURRENT} & \private & current address in sound data\\
    \fname{END} & \private & end address of sound data\\
